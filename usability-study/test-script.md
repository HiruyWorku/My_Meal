# Introduction
Hello and thank you for agreeing to participate in our usability testing session for MyMeal. Today, we are going to ask you to perform a few tasks using a prototype of our app. This test is designed to identify any areas where users like you might experience confusion or difficulty.

This is not a test of your abilities; we are testing our app. So, if something doesn’t work the way you expect, that’s extremely valuable information for us. Please think out loud as you perform the tasks, and feel free to ask questions or share thoughts during the session.

Then we will let you go through the app and attempt to complete the tasks and after that we would love for you to ask us some questions you might have
# Pre-Test Questions
