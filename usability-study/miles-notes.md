# Observer Notes – Participant 2

- Didn't know if they had created an account. Some indicator should probably be provided
- Couldn't figure out the calendar screen. This makes sense especially given that the typing for input collection is at the moment broken.
- Wished for more accessible search screen but had not much trouble interacting with the preexisting search screen.
- Was slightly bothered by search results not being immediately beneath the search bar. This is very fixable
- Wanted many features to be color coded, but I believe that color coding could be offensive to the eyes
- Couldn't figure out how to display the cart on their first try. Clicked on the box instead of the dropdown arrow.
- Didn't immediately notice dropdown when arrow was pressed and it was still empty.

# Observer Notes – Participant 3

- Expected app to be a primarily nutritional service
- Enjoys community and perspectives from social media services
- Before signing up, she started typing on the log in screen. It was not obvious to her that the log in was separate from the sign up screen
- Immediately realized she had to click the pictures to see posts
- Struggled to identify hearts to like a post. She was looking at darker foods and they were not at all visible.
- She attempted to type filters into the search bar instead of clicking on the hamburger icon to access the filters. It was pointed out after c continuous failure and she progressed.
- She did identify the intended way to add to the grocery list but did not realize the typed input
- She did not successfully open the cart to see the additions. She opened it then closed it.
- She thought that the app was very easy to navigate despite the flaws.
