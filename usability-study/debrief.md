## Summary of Findings

We simulated tests with three participants and gathered their feedback. Each participant provided a different perspective, which helped us understand areas for improvement and strengths in the app.

## Ranked Issues & Resolution Plan

1. **Difficulty finding dietary preferences (High Priority)**  
   Add a labeled settings icon or a banner prompt after sign-up for new users.
   Within the search feature, the hamburger icon should be labeled to imply the location of the filters. Alternatively, a filter icon could replace the hamburger to improve this.

2. **Confusing Cart Tab (High Priority)**
   Instead of requiring that the triangle be pressed to view the contents of the dropdown, it should always be down. The cart should also be labeled as empty when empty.

3. **Calendar feature unclear (Medium Priority)**  
   Include text to indicate that the week of input needs to be clicked. Also, there should be a dropdown to move one month ahead.

4. **Need search bar on main page (Low Priority)**  
   Establish relationships between the search bar and the other tabs

5. **Identify whether the sign up or login screen is active (Medium Priority)**
   Include a header to identify whether you are signing up or logging in.

6. **Consider color coding nutrition(Very Low Priority)**
   We could consider limited colorcoding of nutritional items within our colorscheme, but it could add unintended emphasis

7. **Make posts shown in profile link to actual posts(High Priority)**
   We should have linked the pictures to posts already. This is what needs to be done.

8. **The like button is often invisible(High Priority)**
   The like button on each post can often not be seen because the black blends into the shadows on the posts. To solve this, we could consider changing the color of the unclicked like to white or light pink.
