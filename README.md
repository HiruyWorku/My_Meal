# MyMeal by HeyStudents
Thank you so much for exploring our application. Current food focused social media apps were often created to guide their users in following diets and reaching health goals. We wanted to create something else, an app entirely focused on the discovery of new recipes with dietary constraints present but not the main focus. This app allows users to present their own recipes and explore those created by others, hopefully leading to a delicious dinner. Users can create posts to share their own recipes, interact with others recipes, develop a grocery list, and plan months ahead. Enjoy and Bon app√©tit!
